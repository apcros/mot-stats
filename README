## Introduction

This is a statistic dashboard for MOT that is using the public data from the UK governement.

https://data.gov.uk/dataset/anonymised_mot_test

##  Why ?

This is mainly an excuse to : 

- Play around with huge datasets (the MOT list translate to a table with 28 millions entries)
- Experiment with Play, a Java web framework

## Todo

Currently there's absolutely nothing done. Here's a very random list of things to be done : 

- Create a Data structure to make the MOT data easier to use
- Allow to queue the generation of new stats
- Create a mockup for the Dashboard using Bootstrap & chart.js
- Clean the Play App from all the examples
- Deploy it on a public server
- Get a travis running
